This repo contains implementation of Self Organizing Map (SOM) also know as Kohonen map or network. A self-organizing map (SOM) 
self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce 
a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, 
and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as 
they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), 
and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space. This 
makes SOMs useful for visualization by creating low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data, akin to multidimensional scaling.
